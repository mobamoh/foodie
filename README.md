# Foodie Project

This project, named "Foodie", is a demonstration of various concepts in software development, including Microservices with Spring Boot, Clean Architecture, Domain-Driven Design (DDD), SAGA, Outbox, Kafka, and Maven multi-module.

## Overview

Foodie is a system that aims to provide a platform for food lovers to explore, discover, and order food. It consists of multiple microservices, each responsible for a specific aspect of the overall system. The project follows the principles of Clean Architecture and Domain-Driven Design to ensure a modular, scalable, and maintainable codebase.

## Microservices Spring Boot

The Foodie project is built using the Spring Boot framework, which enables the development of microservices using Java. Spring Boot provides a lightweight and opinionated approach to building standalone, production-ready Spring-based applications.

## Clean Architecture

The project adopts Clean Architecture principles, which emphasize separation of concerns and independence between layers of an application. The architecture consists of multiple layers, including the Domain layer (business logic and domain models), Application layer (use cases and application-specific logic), and Infrastructure layer (external dependencies and frameworks).

## DDD (Domain-Driven Design)

Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is a software development approach that focuses on modeling the business domain and aligning the codebase with the domain concepts. In the Foodie project, DDD principles are applied to identify and model the core domain entities, aggregates, value objects, and services, ensuring a clear and expressive representation of the business logic.

## SAGA (Saga Pattern)

The Foodie project implements the Saga pattern to manage distributed transactions across multiple microservices. The Saga pattern provides a way to orchestrate a series of local transactions that together form a global transaction. This enables maintaining consistency and data integrity in a distributed system.

## Outbox Pattern

To ensure data consistency and reliable messaging, the Foodie project utilizes the Outbox pattern. The Outbox pattern involves capturing changes to the application's data and storing them in an outbox table. These changes are then picked up asynchronously by another process, such as a message broker like Kafka, for further processing and delivery to other microservices.

## Kafka

Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform used in the Foodie project for reliable messaging and communication between microservices. It enables the asynchronous processing of events, allowing microservices to communicate and react to changes in the system.

## Maven Multi-Module

The Foodie project is organized as a Maven multi-module project. This structure allows the codebase to be divided into multiple modules, each representing a separate microservice or logical component. Maven's multi-module functionality simplifies dependency management, builds, and testing, providing a modular and scalable project structure.
